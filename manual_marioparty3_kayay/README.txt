Hello! This is a quick read me for installing the Manual Mario Party 3 apworld, as well as general items and other things.

INSTALLATION

- Unzip this first!
- Place the apworld into the "worlds" folder as normal
- Navigate to your "Bizhawk" folder. If you do not have bizhawk installed, please do so. In the root of the Bizhawk folder, place the N64 folder found in Bizhawk Stuff. This contains the save data for properly playing the game.

BEFORE PLAYING

Because the apworld uses the Manual template, there isn't much more to do other than to load the Manual client and one more thing on Bizhawk's end.

- In the Manual client, enter "Manual_MarioParty3_KayayV1" (without the quotes) into the Manual Game ID field.
- After that, connect to the server as normal!

- On the BizHawk end, load your Mario Party 3 ROM file in BizHawk. 
- Next, on the top ribbon, go to Tools -> RamWatch. Finally, load the MP3 Watch file into RamWatch. 
	This file is located within the "Bizhawk Stuff" folder in the Mario Party 3 - Manual AP folder you installed.

You're all set!

WHAT DOES WHAT?

Finally, since this is a Manual apworld, you're gonna have to do some imagination on what is all blocked and what is all not blocked.
There are items that will "unlock" more checks in your game. These are:

- "Board" Toy Box (This unlocks the board for you to play in)
	The objectives on each map are:
	- Pass turn 5
	- Collect 50 coins
	- Collect a Star
	- Land on an Item Space (Your player character must do this, not a CPU)
	- Land on a Happening Space (Your player character must do this, not a CPU)
	- Land on a "Special" Space (These are: Bowser, Battle, Bank, Chance Time, Game Guy. Your player character must do this, not a CPU)

- "Game Guy's Game Pass" (This unlocks the minigame room)
	There are a few locations here, such as
	- Have Over 100 Coins in Game Guy's Game Room
	- Clear any course from Dizzy Dinghies
	- Win a Random Battle in the Battle Room

- And finally, "Filled Out Stamp Card"
	This is considered your "go mode", and allows you to beat the Millenium Star in Stardust Battle
	After beating the Millenium Star, you can go ahead and press the "Victory" button


There are other items as well that are not related to progression

- "Progressive" Starting Coins
	These let you start out with more coins at the start of the game. 
	You can change the value of coins on Turn 1 by using the "Poke Address" button in RAM Watch.

- Coins
	These give you coins during board play.
	Change the value of coins immediately during the board gameplay using the "Poke Address" button in RAM Watch.

- Traps
	These remove coins during board play.
	Since Manual does not have support for Traps as of this moment, all traps are marked with the "Trap:" prefix.
	Change the value of coins immediately during the board gameplay using the "Poke Address" button in RAM Watch.
- ???
	There are currently some items that have no use to support the amount of locations in the game
	For Example: "Genie-less Lamp"
	If you get any item like this, it does nothing. Don't worry about it.

FINAL WORDS

Yes, you can cheat. Since this is a Manual thing and I'm giving you direct access to coin amounts, you CAN cheat, but I don't condone it.

Finally, if you want to adjust any of the locations to be less coins, or add something, go ahead! I'm still working out a good balance of things
for Mario Party 3, and the more input that's recieved the better!
